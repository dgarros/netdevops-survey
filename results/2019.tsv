It feels like in the past couple of years we've all been told that we all need radically different skill sets, and we need them immediately, or we'll all be irrelevant. Whereas in reality, recruiters are telling me that all these ""essential"" skills are fundamentally lacking across the entire spectrum.  I don't deny for a second that automation is the future of the industry, but I do think that the champions of automation are also the true experts of the industry, and don't reflect the skillset of the average engineer.  Juniper is doing truly brilliant work in creating and supporting projects that help network engineers to develop these skills for free. But let's be under no illusions: for the average person, learning a scripting language in itself is a skills that takes years to truly master, let alone all the rest of it. The vendors are fully prepared for a world of automation, but the average engineer and the average customer is many years away from being competent at it."
