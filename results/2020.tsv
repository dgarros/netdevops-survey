Let me put in two cents :)  At my current position I have been focused on network automation for almost two years, especially configuration management in Cisco/Juniper DC environment. Tightly have worked with such technologies like: Infra as code, Gitlab, Ansible, NAPALM. The more I am involved in network automation the more I get disappointed in black box networking: config changes are hard to test and validate, a handful of vendors supports declarative configuration model, SNMP is still our best friend for monitoring.  I really like what NVIDIA Cumulus Linux does. You can easily build a lab topology in eve-ng, make it a part of your CI/CD pipeline and validate changes before deployment. Cumulus is Linux, you are not limited with SNMP for monitoring – run zabbix-agent and obtain any metric you want. Last but not least is supporting declarative configuration model – do not think which commands must be sent to a switch, just create a config file from a template and apply it.  I am quite curtain we should push our industry towards Linux networking. With no doubt it will bring us a lot of benefits. Unfortunately, I suppose major vendors have an opposite point of view :) But we, as community and customers, can influence on network vendors showing our need in open-source!  P.S. This year Nokia has developed a new network OS, called SR Linux. Great! Another big step towards open source networking. "

I started with general, non-network Python in December 2016, then moved to Ansible in April 2017. By September of 2017, I was very strong with Ansible, and had automated about 60% of our daily operations in our growing service provider network. This included config mgmt, config backups, fault isolation, health checking, and more. By January 2018, that number was closer to 90% and also included Gitlab CI/CD and ChatOps with Mattermost. It was a complete infra-as-code solution that took about a full year to build. This is a transition that takes roughly 800-1000 hours for senior engineers with programming experience (me), but may take twice that long for junior engineers and/or those with no programming experience. For context, 1000 hours is 6 months of full-time work, and 2000 hours is a year of full-time work by US standards."

My experience has been that those two disciplines are two distinct and that this model doesn't work well at scale (at least with small teams ~5-6 people).  A larger team, or a team that isn't responsible for operations, might be able to pull this off, but it definitely doesn't work on my current team of 5-6 people who do all the network stuff + try to write automation.  The network operations work always takes priority and building robust automation platforms and observability platforms (not just power tools) keeps getting pushed down the road.    I work at a software company.  The problem seems to be that they think that networks can (and should) be run exactly like servers - and I don't disagree, in theory; however, they don't understand that DevOps folks are using their traditional System Engineering skills, along with programming/config management tools, to reduce operational toil.  Network engineers, on the other hand, can't use traditional Network Engineering skills to reduce network operations toil -- Network Engineers must learn System Engineer skills and programming/config management tools to reduce their operational toil -- or NetEng needs to partner with folks who can do those things.  The learning curve for traditional NetEng folks is much greater than that for traditional SysEng folks, but it's really hard to get management to see that.  So, I'm currently working on a team that is trying to do NetDevOps, but instead we are ending up doing everything poorly, because network operations continually get's prioritized over network automation initiatives.  The code that has been written lacks documentation, testing, and is mostly broken now.  I'm actually passionate about network automation, but I'm stuck doing very manual network operations work, because we don't have time to automate ourselves out of the cycle...   "
